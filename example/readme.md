# Ragu Example

This folder is an example of what a [ragu](https://github.com/saibotsivad/ragu)-built website might look like.

## Files and Folders

### [/content](./content)

This would be your normal folder of Markdown files. It has a home page ([/content/index.md](./content/index.md)), an example "page" ([/content/about.md](./content/about.md)), and an example date-based "post" ([/content/posts/2022-08-15.md](./content/posts/2022-08-15.md)).

Of course, this is just an example, and you can organize things in whatever way makes sense to you.

### [/.gitignore](./.gitignore)

Our build output will be in `/build` so we ignore it.

### [/ragu.config.js](./ragu.config.js)

This is the real *meat* of the example. üçù
