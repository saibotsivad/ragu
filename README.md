# Ragu

Yet another Markdown to static HTML generator. This one is based on [Noddity](http://noddity.com/), but with some twists.

You can use this as a CLI tool, or programmatically.

> Why is it named `ragu`? Because it's a family favorite sauce. â€“Tobias

## Install

The usual ways:

```bash
npm install ragu
# or as a global CLI tool:
npm install -g ragu
```

## Setup

Before you can build your site, you'll need to configure a few things, and define your Markdown flavor using Micromark and mdast extensions.

You do that by creating a file `ragu.config.js` which exports a default options object:

```js

```
